            <p> Hi im ritesh and thats totally a photo of me. These are words and I will paste something now for filler. W3Schools is optimized for learning, testing, and training.

            <h2> More about Me </h2>
            <p> This is a second section. Now I need to find more filler. f your div has a set height in css that will cause it to overflow outside of the div. You could give the div a min-height if you need to have it be a minimum height on the div at all times. Min-height will not work in IE6 though, if you have an IE6 specific stylesheet you can give it a regular height for IE6. Height changes in IE6 according to the content within.</p>
