            <h2> Meet the Master </h2>
            <p>    My name is Ritesh! I have been taking photos for 5 + years. 
                In highschool, I took 2 photography classes which instilled the love
                of photography within me. In the class, I learned how to work with Film 
                cameras and developing them but also with digital cameras in 
                a studio setting with proper lighting. I have no bounds when 
                it comes to what kind of photos I shoot. 
                In this website, you will be getting a peek into my world of 
                Portrait and Landscape Photograpy.
